# caddy-log-exporter ðŸ“ˆðŸ™ˆðŸ™‰ðŸ™Š

Uses the [caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) [json log](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/directives/log) and exports metrics from parsing them for [prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) or [victoriametrics](https://victoriametrics.com/).

## Why

I use the wonderful caddy server just everywhere. There are two things that i discovered. For once there is still the thing that the caddy metrics doesnt add the host as label. There are some github issues about it and im sure that this feature will be added at one point. until now its a problem if you have multiple domains behind a caddy instance.

The other point is: i run a little [gitea](https://about.gitea.com/) instance for some little projects on a small vserver from hetzner. some weeks ago i got prometheus alerts for cpu and memory exhaustion. i checked logs and everything and found out that i got a victim of this stupid fucked up ai craweler shit. so i start to check my caddy logs if i discover high load on my server and add the user agents to my `Caddyfile`. i thought it would be nice to find a top list of scraper bots that gets by my caddy server. so this exporter also adds the user agents as prometheus labels.

Happily, all the stuff we need is available through the standard json logs ðŸ¥³ðŸŽ‰, we tail them and create metrics out of them.

## Installation

Grab the latest docker image from [here](https://github.com/xsteadfastx/caddy-log-exporter/pkgs/container/caddy-log-exporter).

## Usage

`docker run -v /var/log/caddy:/var/log/caddy -e CADDY_LOG_EXPORTER_LOG_FILES=/var/log/caddy/caddy.log ghcr.io/xsteadfastx/caddy-log-exporter:0.1.0-rc6`

### Caddyfile

Enabling the json log to file.

    log {
        format json
        output file /var/log/caddy/caddy.log
    }

### Scraping

    - job_name: caddy-log-exporter
      scheme: http
      static_configs:
        - targets:
            - "caddy-log-exporter.tld:2112"

### Bonus: Blocking AI bots in caddy

    git.foo.tld {
        @badbots {
            header User-Agent *AhrefsBot*
            header User-Agent *Amazonbot*
            header User-Agent *Barkrowler*
            header User-Agent *Bytespider*
            header User-Agent *DataForSeoBot*
            header User-Agent *ImagesiftBot*
            header User-Agent *MJ12bot*
            header User-Agent *PetalBot*
            header User-Agent *SemrushBot*
            header User-Agent *facebookexternalhit*
            header User-Agent *meta-externalagent*
        }

        abort @badbots

        cache
        reverse_proxy gitea:3000
    }
